Tin-dog solo project:

This project is part of my assignment on scrimba organisation to demonstrate this requirement
through the course of building the project:
(a) Followed the design spec on figma
(b) Used Javascript classes 
(c) Used modules(import/export) are must.

I had a great fun building the functionality of this app via using javascript, css and html.
